# Student Support

ICAPS secured funding from NSF and AI Journal to support studentsâ€™ participation at the conference. The NSF funding is targeted to students from US-based institutes only; the AIJ funding is for students from other institutes. The funding will be distributed as (partial) reimbursement of expenses after the conference to selected students. 

ICAPS provides student support partly covering **travel and/or registration costs** thanks to our sponsors (see footer of this webpage). 

The exact amount depends on the amount collected from sponsors, your location, and the number of other applicants. We aim to cover at least the travel costs for supported students.

Please apply for student support by submitting a request through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icaps23) (Track: **Student Travel grants**) submitting the following information:
* a short description of your active contribution in ICAPS (e.g., paper presentation, DC, etc)
* a proposed budget and why support is needed
* a recommendation letter (in PDF) signed by your supervisor/advisor

**The deadline for applying is May 1, 2023**. 

Notification is May 4 (one day before the early registration day). Scholarships will be provided to you after the conference as reimbursement of the expenses properly evidenced by receipts/invoices.
