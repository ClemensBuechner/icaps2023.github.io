# Student Support

ICAPS secured funding from NSF and AI Journal to support studentsâ€™ participation at the conference. The NSF funding is targeted to students from US-based institutes only; the AIJ funding is for students from other institutes. The funding will be distributed as (partial) reimbursement of expenses after the conference to selected students. 

More details (e.g., how to apply for support) will be posted on this page later.
