# ICAPS 2023 Doctoral Consortium

The Doctoral Consortium (DC) is intended to give Ph.D. students the opportunity to closely interact with established researchers and get feedback on their research, provide advice on career possibilities and build a professional network, improving the cohesion of new researchers with the ICAPS community.

The DC is open to all doctoral student attendees of the conference and will take place on **July 8th** (the day before ICAPS workshops and tutorials). Registering for the Doctoral Consortium will be part of the registration process for the conference and all students are invited to take part in it.


## Mentoring Program

As part of the Doctoral Consortium, ICAPS will offer a Mentoring Program. The Mentoring Program is designed to provide Ph.D. students with an opportunity for in-depth advice by senior members of the field regarding careers and research skills. Each student accepted to the program will be matched with an established researcher in the field who will provide research and career management advice at the **Doctoral Consortium day**.

We encourage current doctoral students (students whose Ph.D. is in progress) to apply for the Mentoring Program. Students do not need to be accepted into the Mentoring Program to attend and participate in the Doctoral Consortium.

## Application Procedure for the Mentoring Program

To participate in the Mentoring Program, an application is required. Applicants for the Mentoring Program should submit a **single PDF** file at [https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=icaps23](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=icaps23)  (**Doctoral Consortium Submission**) containing:

- A dissertation abstract (not a paper) of at most **4 pages**, using AAAI style. The abstract should include an overview of the Ph.D. thesis topic, a summary of the work done so far and future directions.
- A **CV**.
- A **letter from the candidate’s Ph.D. advisor**, program coordinator, or the school administration confirming the applicant’s enrollment in the Ph.D. program.
- A **representative/exemplary conference publication** (to share with a mentor – optional).
- A list of **potential mentors** (optional)


## Important Dates for the Mentoring Program
