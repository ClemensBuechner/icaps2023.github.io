# ICAPS 2023 Doctoral Consortium

The ICAPS Doctoral Consortium (DC) is intended to provide Ph.D. students with the opportunity to interact closely with established researchers and to get feedback on their research, provide advice on career possibilities and build a professional network, improving the cohesion of new researchers with the ICAPS community.

The DC is open to all doctoral student attendees of the conference and will take place on Sunday, **July 8th** (the day before ICAPS workshops and tutorials). Attendance is free for everybody joining ICAPS, participation in the Mentoring Program requires registration with the organizers.

More details coming soon!
