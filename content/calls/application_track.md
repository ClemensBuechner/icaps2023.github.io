# ICAPS 2023 Call for Papers: Industry and Applications Track

TBA

## Author Guidelines
Authors may submit long papers (8 pages plus up to one page of references) or short papers (4 pages plus up to one page of references). The type of paper must be indicated at submission time. Both long and short papers will be reviewed against the standard criteria of relevance, originality, significance, clarity and soundness, and are expected to meet the high standards set by ICAPS. Short papers may be of narrower scope. For example, they can either address a highly specific issue, or propose/evaluate a small, yet important, extension of previous work or a new idea.

Authors making multiple submissions must ensure that each submission has significant unique content. Papers submitted to ICAPS 2023 may not be submitted to other conferences or journals during the ICAPS 2023 review period, nor may be already under review or published in other conferences or journals. Over-length papers will be rejected without review.

## Ethical/Societal Impact

It is optional for authors to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. This statement can be included in either the main body pages or the reference page. If such a statement is not included in the paper but the reviewers deem that such a statement is necessary, then the authors will be asked to provide one during the author response period for review. If the paper is accepted, the statement provided will need to be incorporated in the camera-ready version.

## Submission Instructions

All submissions will be made electronically, through the [EasyChair conference system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icaps23). Submitted PDF papers should be anonymous for double-blind reviewing, adhere to the page limits of the relevant track CFP/submission type (long or short), and follow the [AAAI author kit instructions for formatting](https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AnonymousSubmission23.zip).

In addition to the submitted PDF paper, authors can submit supplementary material (videos, technical proofs, additional experimental results) for their paper. Please make sure that the supporting material is also anonymized. Papers should be self-contained; reviewers are encouraged, but not obligated, to consider supporting material in their decision.

The proceedings will be published by AAAI Press. All accepted papers will be published in the main conference proceedings and will be presented orally at the conference (full papers will be allocated more time).
