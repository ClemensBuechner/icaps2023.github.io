      <description>How hard can it be? The computational complexity of planning Description Understanding the computational complexity of a problem is one of the first steps to understand the problem deeply. Automated planning problems are not an exception, and indeed the complexity of planning is a well studied topic in the literature of the field.
Most people in the planning community are familiar with the seminal result by Bylander showing that classical STRIPS planning is PSPACE-complete, but the topic is far from being exhausted by this result.</description>

      <description>On the role of Large Language Models in Planning Description Large Language Models (LLMs, or n-gram models on steroids) that have been trained originally to generate text by repeatedly predicting the next word in the context of a window of previous words, have captured the attention of the AI (and the world) community. Part of the reason for this is their ability to produce meaningful completions for prompts relating to almost any area of human intellectual endeavors.</description>

      <description>Recent Advances in Temporal Networks for Planning and Scheduling Description Temporal networks are structures for representing and reasoning about time (e.g., in planning and scheduling applications). Different flavors of temporal networks differ in their expressiveness and the complexity of the algorithms for solving relevant problems. The most basic kind of temporal network is a Simple Temporal Network (STN). STNs have a solid theoretical foundation and numerous practical algorithms for manipulating STNs have been presented in the literature over the past 30 years.</description>

      <description>Unified Planning: A Python Library Making Planning Technology Accessible Description The Unified Planning framework (UP) is a Python library giving uniform access to a large variety of planning approaches and engines. It is designed around two concepts: advanced modeling primitives to express planning problems mixing declarative and procedural paradigms; and ``operation modes&#39;&#39;, which define the classes of interaction with planning engines. The library has been developed as part of the Horizon 2020 AIPlan4EU project and will at the end of the year 2023 become an independent open-source project that is free to use and extend by everyone.</description>

      <description>IntEx: Integrated Acting, Planning and Execution ICAPS&#39;23 Workshop Prague, Czech Republic July 9-10, 2023
Aim and Scope of the Workshop Automated planners are increasingly being integrated into online acting systems. The integration may, for example, embed a domain-independent temporal planner in a manufacturing system (e.g., the Xerox printer application) or autonomous vehicles (e.g., a planetary rover or anunderwater glider). The integration may resemble something more like an &amp;ldquo;acting and planning stack&amp;rdquo; where an automated planner produces an activity or task plan that is further refined by an actor before being executed by the execution platform of the actor, such as, a reactive controller (e.</description>

      <description>HAXP: Human-Aware and Explainable Planning ICAPS&#39;23 Workshop Prague, Czech Republic July 9-10, 2023
We merged with the Plan, Activity, and Intent Recognition (PAIR) Workshop
Aim and Scope of the Workshop As artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being adopted into application solutions, the challenge of supporting effective interactions with humans is becoming more apparent. Partly this is to support integrated working styles, in which humans and intelligent systems cooperate in problem-solving, but also it is a necessary step in the process of building and calibrating trust as humans migrate greater competence and responsibility to such systems.</description>

      <description>Knowledge Engineering for Planning and Scheduling (KEPS 2023) 2023 Workshop on Knowledge Engineering for Planning and Scheduling Prague, Czech Republic July 9-10, 2023
Aim and Scope of the Workshop Despite the progress in automated planning and scheduling systems, these systems still need to be fed by carefully engineered domain and problem descriptions and they need to be fine-tuned for particular domains and problems. Knowledge engineering for AI planning and scheduling deals with the acquisition, design, validation and maintenance of domain models, and the selection and optimization of appropriate machinery to work on them.</description>

      <description>Planning and Robotics (PlanRob 2023) ICAPS&#39;23 Workshop Prague, Czech Republic July 9-10, 2023
Aim and Scope of the Workshop AI Planning &amp;amp; Scheduling (P&amp;amp;S) methods are key to enabling intelligent robots to perform autonomous, flexible, and interactive behaviours. Researchers in the P&amp;amp;S community have continued to develop approaches and produce planners, representations, as well as heuristics that robotics researchers can make use of. However, there remain numerous challenges complicating the uptake, use and successful integration of P&amp;amp;S technology in robotics, many of which have been addressed by robotics researchers with novel solutions.</description>

      <description>PLanning And onTology wOrkshop (PLATO) ICAPS&#39;23 Workshop Prague, Czech Republic July 9-10, 2023
Aim and Scope of the Workshop Automated Planning and Ontology are two well-established fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The former investigates techniques to formally model and reason about the effects of actions, and decide the combinations of actions that allow an agent to achieve goals. The latter investigates techniques to formally define knowledge (by formally describing domain entities and their interrelations), allowing agents to process information about objects, and events, and incrementally build and verify beliefs.</description>
